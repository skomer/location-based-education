# Location-based Education

## The Brief

Working as a team to create an educational web app calling on an external API, written in vanilla JavaScript with no frameworks.

## The Project

We designed and built a quiz application using the Google Maps API, where a user can both participate in a quiz and create their own quizzes for others to take.
